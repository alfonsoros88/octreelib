# OctreeLib

This is a fork from the [OctreeLib](https://github.com/ais-hilgert/octreelib).

This version is a refactoring from the original using C++11 features and
documenting the code with Doxygen.

## Requirements

* CMake >= 2.8
* Doxygen (optional)
* C++11 standard support

## Instalation

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

To generate the documentation:

```bash
$ make doc
```
